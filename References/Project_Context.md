# Nely MVP: Simple Elderly Health Tracking for Malaysian Families

## Vision
Become Malaysia's most trusted family health coordination platform.

## Mission
Help Malaysian families keep track of their elderly parents' health, together.

## Value Proposition
"Finally, a simple way for the whole family to stay connected to mom and dad's health - whether you're in the same house or across the city."

## The Problem (Keep It Simple)
- Adult children worry about elderly parents living separately
- Hard to coordinate health information among family members
- Elderly forget to take medications or track their health
- Family members don't know when to worry or when things are fine

## Target Users (Start Small)
**Primary**: Malaysian families with elderly parents
- Adult children (20-50) with smartphones
- Elderly parents who may/may not use smartphones
- Focus: Lower/Middle-class families who can afford basic healthcare but want better coordination

## Core Features (MVP Only)

### 1. Simple Health Tracking
- **Blood pressure** (most common elderly health concern)
- **Blood glucose** (diabetes epidemic)
- **Medication reminders** (biggest daily challenge)
- **Weight** (easy to track)
- **Notes** (how they're feeling today)

**Input Methods**:
- Large-button manual entry (elderly-friendly)
- Family members can enter for elderly
- Photo of device readings (OCR for BP monitors, glucometers)

### 2. Family Groups (Up to 5 People)
- Create family group around 1 elderly person
- All family members see the same health data
- Simple roles: "Elderly Person" and "Family Member"
- Everyone gets notifications for concerning readings

### 3. Smart Alerts (Not AI - Just Simple Rules)
- **Red Alert**: BP above 180/110, glucose above 250 → immediate attention needed
- **Yellow Alert**: Readings trending up, missed medications 2+ days
- **Green**: Everything normal, simple weekly summaries

### 4. Basic Languages
- **Bahasa Malaysia** (essential)
- **English** (urban families)
- Simple interface that works for both languages

## What We're NOT Doing (At Launch)
❌ Traditional medicine tracking  
❌ Multiple elderly per family  
❌ Healthcare provider integration  
❌ Mandarin/Tamil (Phase 2)  
❌ Rural offline mode (Phase 2)  
❌ Insurance partnerships  
❌ Advanced AI insights  
❌ Community features  
❌ Religious calendar integration  

## Revenue Model (Simple)
- **Free**: Basic tracking for 1 elderly person, up to 3 family members, with mobile ads
- **Premium (RM19.90/month)**: Up to 5 family members, detailed health reports, priority support, **no ads**

## Go-to-Market (Focus!)
1. **Facebook/Instagram/Tiktok ads** targeting adult children in KL (20-45 years old)
2. **Pharmacy partnerships** - demo at Guardian/Watsons with BP monitor bundles
3. **Word of mouth** - referral program for families

## Success Metrics (6 Months)
- 1,000 active elderly profiles
- 70% user retention after 1 month
- Average 3 family members per elderly person
- 15% conversion to premium

## Tech Stack (Keep It Simple)
- **React Native** (iOS + Android)
- **Supabase** (backend + database)
- **Hosted in Singapore** (good enough for Malaysia)
- **Basic OCR** for device reading photos

## Why This Will Work
1. **Solves real daily pain** - families already struggle with this
2. **Network effect** - whole family needs to use it together
3. **Malaysian context** - designed for how Malaysian families actually work
4. **Simple enough** - elderly can use it, families will adopt it

## Phase 2 (Only After MVP Success)
- Traditional medicine tracking
- More languages (Mandarin, Tamil)
- Multiple elderly per family
- Rural offline features
- Healthcare provider connections

## The Real Vision (Internal Only)
Yes, we want to become the leading elderly care platform in ASEAN. But first, we need to nail the basics:
1. **Prove product-market fit** in urban Malaysia
2. **Build the network effects** with families
3. **Establish trust** in health data handling
4. **Then expand** features, languages, regions

**Like Grab**: Started as just taxi booking in KL. Now it's super-app.
**Like Shopee**: Started as simple C2C marketplace. Now it's everything.
**Like Life360**: Started as family location sharing. Now it's family safety platform.

We start simple. We execute well. We grow from there.

## Immediate Next Steps (30 Days)
1. **Build basic prototype** - health tracking + family groups
2. **Interview 20 families** in KL - validate the core problem
3. **Test with 5 beta families** - make sure it actually works
4. **Launch simple landing page** - start collecting early interest

**That's it. No more planning. Time to build and test.**
