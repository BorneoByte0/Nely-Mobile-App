### Multi-Ethnic Considerations
**Chinese Malaysian Preferences**

- Blue: Wisdom, reliability, traditional medicine trust
- Avoiding excessive red (while using it judiciously for alerts)

**Indian Malaysian Preferences**

- Complementary to traditional color preferences

**Malay Cultural Integration**

## Accessibility & Compliance

### WCAG AA Standards
**Contrast Ratios Achieved:**
- Text on White: 21:1 (Exceeds AA standard of 4.5:1)

- Blue on White: 7.1:1 (Exceeds AA standard)
- Red on White: 5.9:1 (Exceeds AA standard)

### Color Blindness Considerations
**Deuteranopia (Red-Green Blindness)**
- Blue remains distinct from both green and red
- Amber provides sufficient contrast alternative
- Icons and text labels supplement color coding

**Protanopia (Red Blindness)**
- Green and blue remain clearly distinguishable
- Critical alerts use both color and iconography
- Multiple visual cues beyond color alone

**Tritanopia (Blue-Yellow Blindness)**
- Green and red remain distinct
- High contrast text ensures readability
- Status communication through multiple visual elements

## Healthcare Application Context

### Medical Interface Standards
**Trust Building Colors**
- Cool blues for professional reliability
- Clean whites for medical data clarity
- Appropriate greens for positive health outcomes
- Restrained red usage only for genuine medical alerts

**Elderly User Considerations**
- High contrast ratios for age-related vision changes
- Warmer undertones in grays to reduce harsh clinical feel
- Sufficient color differentiation for medication management
- Clear status indicators for health data interpretation

### Family Coordination Colors
**Role Identification**
- Primary green: Family admin actions and primary elderly person
- Secondary blue: Family member contributions and secondary information
- Neutral grays: Background information and inactive states
- Status colors: Health alerts and medication compliance tracking

## Technical Implementation
