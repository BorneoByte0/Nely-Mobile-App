# Family Role Management System - Comprehensive Implementation Phases

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation phases for the Nely family role management system, based on FamilyRole.md requirements and the database foundation that has been established.

## Database Foundation Status  COMPLETED
The following database migrations have been successfully implemented:
-  `09_create_appointment_outcomes.sql` - Appointment outcomes with family-based RLS
-  `10_create_user_family_roles.sql` - Core family role management system
-  `11_update_family_group_function.sql` - Family creation/joining with role assignment
-  `12_create_family_join_requests.sql` - Admin approval workflow for family joining

## Family Role Requirements Summary
Based on FamilyRole.md, the system must implement:

### Auto-Assignment Rules:
- **Family Creators**: Both elderly and non-elderly users who create a family group automatically become **Admin**
- **Family Joiners**: Both elderly and non-elderly users who join via family code automatically become **Family Viewer**

### Role Permissions:
- **Admin**: Full access to all features and settings + role management
- **Carer**: Can manage health data, medications, and appointments
- **Family Viewer**: Can only view health information (read-only)

### Access Control:
- Profile screen role management section: **Admin-only access**
- Role management screen: **Admin-only** - can change user roles and accept join requests

## Quality Assurance & Testing

### Critical Test Cases:
- [ ] **Role Assignment Tests**:
  - Family creators become admin (elderly and non-elderly)
  - Family joiners become family_viewer (elderly and non-elderly)
  - Role changes by admin work correctly
  - Non-admins cannot change roles

- [ ] **Permission Tests**:
  - Family Viewers cannot edit health data
  - Carers can manage health but not roles
  - Admins have full access
  - Unauthorized access is properly blocked

- [ ] **Join Request Tests**:
  - Request creation works properly
  - Admin approval/rejection functions correctly
  - Status updates reach users appropriately
  - Only admins can manage requests

### Security Validation:
- [ ] **RLS Policy Testing**: Verify all database policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] **Role Escalation Prevention**: Ensure users cannot elevate their own roles
- [ ] **Family Isolation**: Confirm users can only access their family's data
- [ ] **Admin Protection**: Prevent family from being left without an admin

### Phase 1-2 Success Criteria:
- [ ] Family creation auto-assigns admin role correctly
- [ ] Join requests are created instead of direct joining
- [ ] Admin approval workflow functions without errors
- [ ] All role assignments follow FamilyRole.md rules

### Phase 3-4 Success Criteria:
- [ ] Role management interface works intuitively for admins
- [ ] Permission-based UI hides/shows appropriate features
- [ ] All screens respect role-based access control
- [ ] Family Viewers have read-only access to health data

### Overall Success Metrics:
- [ ] 100% compliance with FamilyRole.md requirements
- [ ] Zero unauthorized access to role management features
- [ ] Family role operations complete in <2 seconds
- [ ] User satisfaction >4.5/5 for family management features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Database Performance**: RLS policies may impact query performance with large families
- **State Management**: Role state synchronization across app components
- **Permission Complexity**: Ensuring consistent permission checks throughout app

### User Experience Risks:
- **Role Confusion**: Clear role descriptions and visual indicators needed
- **Admin Burden**: Streamlined approval workflows to prevent admin fatigue
- **Permission Frustration**: Clear messaging when users lack permissions

### Security Risks:
- **Privilege Escalation**: Thorough testing of role assignment functions
- **Family Data Leakage**: Validation of family-based data isolation
- **Admin Account Compromise**: Audit trails and role change notifications
