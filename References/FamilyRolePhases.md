- [ ] Create notification history for family events
- [ ] Add email notifications for important role events

#### 5C: Onboarding and Help
- [ ] Update onboarding flow to explain family roles
- [ ] Add role-specific help sections
- [ ] Create tutorial for admin role management
- [ ] Add contextual help for family joining process

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
**Duration: 3-4 days**
**Priority: LOW**

#### 6A: Family Management Enhancements
- [ ] Add family member invitation via email
- [ ] Implement family member removal (admin-only)
- [ ] Add family settings and preferences
- [ ] Create family activity audit log

#### 6B: Role Delegation and Temporary Access
- [ ] Implement temporary role elevation for specific tasks
- [ ] Add role delegation for admin absences
- [ ] Create emergency access protocols
- [ ] Add role expiration and renewal system

#### 6C: Multi-Family Support (Future Consideration)
- [ ] Design system for users to belong to multiple families
- [ ] Implement family switching interface
- [ ] Add cross-family role management
- [ ] Create family relationship mapping

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration Points
```typescript
// Key hooks to implement
useCreateFamilyJoinRequest(familyCode: string, message?: string)
useReviewFamilyJoinRequest(requestId: string, action: 'approve' | 'reject', message?: string)
usePendingJoinRequests(familyId: string) // Admin only
useUserJoinRequestStatus(familyCode: string)
useIsCurrentUserAdmin(familyId: string)
useFamilyMembersWithRoles(familyId: string)
useUpdateUserFamilyRole(userId: string, newRole: FamilyRole)
```

### Screen Architecture
```
├── FamilyManagement/
│   ├── JoinRequestScreen.tsx        // For users to request family joining
│   ├── JoinRequestsManagementScreen.tsx // For admins to manage requests
│   ├── RoleManagementScreen.tsx     // For admins to manage member roles
│   └── FamilyMemberCard.tsx         // Reusable component for member display
```

### Permission Integration
```typescript
// Utility functions to implement
const useRolePermissions = (role: FamilyRole) => {
  return {
    canManageRoles: role === 'admin',
    canManageHealth: ['admin', 'carer'].includes(role),
    canViewHealth: ['admin', 'carer', 'family_viewer'].includes(role),
    canAccessRoleManagement: role === 'admin'
  };
};
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all new database hooks
- [ ] Integration tests for role-based permission system
- [ ] E2E tests for family joining and role management flows
- [ ] Security testing for RLS policies and admin functions
- [ ] Performance testing for family member queries

### Security Considerations
- [ ] Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Test admin-only functions with non-admin users
- [ ] Validate all user inputs and family codes
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling doesn't leak information
- [ ] Test role escalation attack scenarios

### User Experience Validation
- [ ] Test with different user personas (elderly, admin, carer)
- [ ] Validate all error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Ensure smooth onboarding for new family members
- [ ] Test edge cases (network failures, concurrent requests)
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2-3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Family join request creation works seamlessly
- [ ] Admin approval workflow functions correctly
- [ ] All role assignments follow FamilyRole.md rules
- [ ] Zero unauthorized access to admin functions

### Phase 4-5 Success Criteria

- [ ] Admin role management interface is intuitive
- [ ] Permission system prevents unauthorized actions
- [ ] User feedback is clear and helpful

### Overall Success Metrics
- [ ] Family creation and joining flows have >95% success rate
- [ ] Role management operations complete in <2 seconds
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities in role system
- [ ] User satisfaction scores >4.5/5 for family management features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance with large families
- **RLS Complexity**: Extensive testing of Row Level Security policies
- **State Management**: Careful handling of role state across app components

### User Experience Risks
- **Role Confusion**: Clear role descriptions and onboarding
- **Admin Burden**: Streamlined approval workflows
- **Permission Clarity**: Obvious visual cues for available actions

### Security Risks
- **Privilege Escalation**: Thorough testing of role assignment functions
- **Data Exposure**: Careful validation of family-based data isolation
- **Admin Compromise**: Audit trails and role change notifications

## Future Enhancements

### Version 2.0 Considerations
- Multi-language support for role descriptions
- Advanced analytics for family engagement
- Integration with external healthcare systems
- Mobile app offline role caching
- AI-powered role recommendations

### Scalability Preparations
- Database indexing optimization for large families
- Caching strategies for role permissions
- Microservice architecture considerations
- Global family network support
